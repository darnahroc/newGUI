# newGUI
the goal of this program will be to give pcgen users and DMs/GMs a platform to be able to manage almost every aspect of their campaign from one place. the plan is to have it linked from within pcgen under the tools menu. as it sits right now this is only the beginning of the GUI that i have done and more will follow.... maybe im being a little ambitious but this is my first foray into the world of java programming and well go big or stay on the couch lmao.... please feel free to leave any tips you have to offer or comments on how i can improve where im headed with this... i have one issue already and that is the code for the GUI, the fxml file, to me looks horrible and entirely too long. someone suggested breaking everything up into sub files and have the main fxml file call on those for each heading needed to set the GUI display, and that may come but as of yet i am unsure how to do that. pointers????
thank you for looking and may Nyx bless you
