notes from gui
**  campaign manager: needs to remember last loaded campaign file to keep appropriate information / or !!!!-->>load campaign file every open???

**  campaign -- quests -- new quest button needs to popup dialog to add quest to list

**  need to make sure file formats each area saves are congruent with pcgen file format where they coincide

** can only have one campaign file loaded at once -- maybe add functionality for more than one campaign open at a time at a later date???

**  possible file extensions specific for this program --
    *.cmc: campaign manager campaign file
    *.cme: campaign manager equipment and items file
    *.cmt: campaign manager treasure file
    *.cml: campaign manager locale file
    *.pcg: pcgen character file
    *.cmp: campaign manager party file
    *.pcc: pcgen campaign info file
    *.lst: pcgen file format for all user editable data and various standard book datasets
    various locations that call for an image shall use bmp, jpg, or png formats only






still left to do for gui layout

locales
encounters
treasure
items
maps


once these tabs are finished then set up menubar

after menubar add IDs to ALL fields to enable functionality

determine how to link given fields to pcgen client for things such as character creation/mod, monster creation/mod

work on file extensions for campaign manager, will actually be a specifically named txt file

print function needs to be available in every tab and heading
    submenu under Edit -- print:
        print lists
        print stat information for every place
        print characters and monsters
        print maps, maybe to scale of actual image size or to scale for standard paper size or choose
